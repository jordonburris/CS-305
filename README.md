Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

 - Artemis Financial is a financial company looking to improve their security for the peace of mind of their users. They wanted encryption for their transactions.
 
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

  - I think I did well at running the dependency check, I think incorporating secure code is almost a nessecity to companies nowadays with all of the cyber attacks. It will add a wellbeing to ensure their information is secure but will also give potential customers a peace of mind as well.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

  - I would say getting the hash from the SSL, but after I undertood a little more things got easier.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

  - We added security on the code as well as on the server and connection.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

  - To make sure it was functioning I would run the code and check for errors, to check for vulnerabilities, I would run the vulnerability scanner to see if anything new had come up.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  - I feel the ability to make a secure will help me in future assignments and even potential jobs.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

  - I would show them the dependency check I ran and also some refactored code for the SHA, and the hash from the code for the connections.
